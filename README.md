This is a super basic CMS using PHP. I wanted to practice manipulating databases, and xml.
This works on my local server, but when I sent it to a host server, I had problems with the directory. 

# I'm having trouble with the chart.  
  1.  I can't get the x axis to read as dates.
  2.  I can't get the data to be read as a string.  It will only read the final point in the string.
